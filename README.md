SpectralKey is SDR Exploration project. It is currently in development! 

## Launch the prototype

On Windows, double-click **Launch SpectralKey.cmd** in this folder, then open http://127.0.0.1:8765 in your browser. Keep the terminal open while using the app; press Ctrl+C to stop it.

The launcher uses an installed Python or the local Codex Python runtime when available. Python 3.10 or newer is required; no third-party packages are needed.

Alternatively, from this repository folder:

```powershell
python "SpectralKey/Prototypes/prototype 1/signal_observatory.py"
```

This is a static preview of the SpectralKey interface. Python only serves the HTML, CSS, logo, and font. Logging controls are disabled; there is no database, audio processing, or signal analysis backend. Existing local observation files are not deleted.
